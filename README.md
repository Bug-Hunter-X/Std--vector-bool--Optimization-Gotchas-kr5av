This repository demonstrates a common error related to the use of `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  The `std::vector<bool>` specialization uses a bitset for memory optimization, leading to subtle differences in behavior compared to other vector types. This can cause unexpected results if the programmer assumes the same behavior as a regular `bool` array. This example highlights the differences and how to avoid common pitfalls.
